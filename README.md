Meet Lydia:
A chat bot who has just been born at the time of opening this program. Everything you say she will learn, and every response you make
she will remember. Maybe some day she will be able to converse with you completely.
Type 
"#help" to learn more. To quit the program, type "#quit" into the command 
prompt.


In order to communicate with the bot, simply type what you want to say into the
input space. When typing please use only lower case characters and no special
characters.

So instead of this: 
"So what's up with y'all!"

Use this:
"So what is up with you all"


The reason for this is that otherwise you would have many entries that are 
copies of the same word, ie Hey, hey, hey! and Hey all mean the same thing
but would be entered differently.

Sometimes what the bot says can be hard to interpret, but keep trying and
use your imagination.
